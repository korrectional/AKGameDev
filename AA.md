You're here to learn how to make godot games!


This will take a while. What you need to do is to watch this tutorial (link below) and have godot open alongside. Remember that just copying code 
without understanding it is stupid and you should never do that.

If you think you understand this, you can begin the "platform" challenge.


[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[
    XP system (how good you are): You need xp to unlock certain challenges and jams, and you earn xp by completing those (how much you get from one is
    indicated with a trace. Ex: platform - 100).

    How challenges work: you complete a challenge at your own pace, and when you are done you let an officer
    judge you.

    How Jams work: At the start of a meeting, if there is enough people that wish to participate in the jam, you will begin working. 
    Different jams have different time limits. Some might span 40 minutes while others can take weeks to complete. If you do better than other people in
    the jam you get a lot of xp.

Challenges:

# platform - 100
Make a simple platformer, where you can collect coins and jump over things.

# bun guns - 130
Make a game where you have a gun that shoots buns, and when a target gets in contact with the bun it gets destroyed.



Jams!!!:

(100xp required to unlock)
# nerdrun - 200 
This is one of the few Jams you will have to do by yourself. Your goal is to make a hopefully but at least mildly entertaining game in 40 minutes (the span of the meeting).
It can be very simple, like the platform game from the challenge, but you gotta rush.
