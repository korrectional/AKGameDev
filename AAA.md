Heeeeee yeaaaa you're smart. Now, its awesome that you are a pro and all, but you gotta prove yourself.
Complete challenges and jams!!!!!!

```
    XP system (how good you are): You need xp to unlock certain challenges and jams, and you earn xp by completing those.

    How challenges work: you complete a challenge at your own pace, and when you are done you let an officer
    judge you.

    How Jams work: At the start of a meeting, if there is enough people that wish to participate in the jam, you will begin working. 
    Different jams have different time limits. Some might span 40 minutes while others can take weeks to complete. If you do better than other people in
    the jam you get a lot of xp.

Note that some challenges from AA reappear here. Don't do them since that would be a waste of time.

# Challenges:

Make a game where you have a gun that shoots buns, and when a target gets in contact with the bun it gets destroyed.

### music - 140

### fake 2d subway surfers - 150
In the ancient times people like to play subway surfers. Now your job is to disapoint everybody by making a fake 2d version of it. Good luck.


# Jams!!!:

### kickstart! - 200
This is a begginer jam tht we will all start together. Basically, you should get make a team or by yourself make a game of your choice (or your team's). We'll
let you know more about it during the meeting.

### nerdrun - 200 
This is one of the few Jams you will have to do by yourself. Your goal is to make a hopefully but at least mildly entertaining game in 40 minutes (the span of the meeting).
It can be very simple, like the platform game from the challenge, but you gotta rush.
